# Team I am not Ok with this

### What is this project?

The OEI is an online repository of forumula's to generate integer sequences. It's often interesting to input in random integers, 
and see what equations can generate the inputted integers.  

Our app visualizes this using a system of nodes and links. 
One sequence is visualized as a left-to-right sequence of nodes, and when two sequences share an integer in the same spot, they share a node.  

Each sequence is given a unique color of link, and nodes are hoverable to reveal what sequence(s) the node belongs to. 
The central nodes will always remain editable, so the user can tinker with slightly adjusting the inputs and seeing what sequences are generated.
